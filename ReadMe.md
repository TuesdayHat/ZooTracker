#### Adam Calhoun

## Description
_User can enter an animal's information for the app to keep track of. The app will display a list of all animals entered, and allow the user to show them all, only young (<=2 years), or only mature (>2 years)_

## Setup


## To Do
* make list of animals a bit more readable (thinking split into 2 columns)
* make the whole thing prettier in general -- styling is mainly functional.
* allow the user to add pictures to animals
* proper database back end so the app does not dump everything when it closes
* timestamps for animal entry; update animal age
  * set animal birthday (if known -- default to entry date otherwise)

## Technologies Used
* JavaScript
* Gulp
* Angularjs
* html
